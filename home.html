            <h1>Don't Know What You Caught?</h1>
            <h3>We Can Help You Figure it Out.</h3>
            <p> What's That Fish is a web application designed to help you 
                identify what type of fish you've caught. Gone are the days where you had
                no idea what you caught, What's That Fish allows you to upload a picture of 
                your catch and we will identify the fish for you!

                <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
                <p>
                    We have developed and trained a machine learning model with hundreds
                    of pictures of fish pulled from the internet. Our model is now able to 
                    identify the type of fish from an image. All you have to do is create an account, upload you image,
                    and let our model do the rest of the work!

                <h1>Can you Catch Them All?</h1>
                <p>
                    Creating an account will allow us to keep track of the different types of fish you have caught.
                    We've based our 'inventory' system on the popular game Pokemon. After you have created an account,
                    you will have access to your own account inventory page. In this page, all the types of fish you
                    have ever caught will be displayed, alongside the photo that you uploaded to our website.

                an account with us and you'll be ready to start tracking your next
